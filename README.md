#  Denoising Diffusion Probablistic Models Continual Learning Training

This repository contains the training script for training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) in a continual learning setting. 

The aim is to improve the model's generalization capabilities by conditioning the latent space.
